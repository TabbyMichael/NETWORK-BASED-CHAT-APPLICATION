Python Network-based Chat Application
This project is a simple networked chat application where multiple clients can connect to a server and send messages to each other in real-time. The server handles multiple clients simultaneously using multithreading. Messages from clients are broadcast to all connected clients.

Features
Multiple clients can connect to the server at the same time.
Messages sent by one client are broadcast to all connected clients.
Multithreading is used to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

Installation
Clone the repository or download the project files.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat_application.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd chat_application
Install any necessary dependencies (if any).

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Server
Open a terminal in the project directory.

Run the following command to start the server:

bash
Copy code
python server.py
This will start the server and listen for client connections on 127.0.0.1:5555.

Running the Client
Open multiple terminals (or separate machines) to simulate multiple clients.

Run the following command in each terminal to start a client:

bash
Copy code
python client.py
Once connected, you can type messages in the terminal and press Enter to send them. Messages will be broadcast to all connected clients.

How It Works
Server: The server listens for incoming connections from clients. When a client connects, the server starts a new thread to handle that client. It then broadcasts any messages received from the client to all other connected clients.

Client: The client connects to the server and sends/receives messages. The client runs two threads—one for sending messages to the server and another for receiving messages from the server.

Next Steps
Usernames: Add usernames to differentiate between users.
Error Handling: Improve error handling for unexpected disconnections.
GUI: Build a graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter for the client.
User Authentication: Add login functionality for clients to authenticate before joining the chat.
